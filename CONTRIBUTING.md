# How to contribute?

Hi there! Want to contribute to this project and achieve ultimate glory?
Good. Just follow the steps below and start hacking :wink:

* Fork this repository

* Clone the fork to your computer

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/webedu.git
    ```
* Install python2 if you haven't already

* **Optional** (but recommended): Create a virtual environment for this project
    
    ```
    $ # Install python2-virtualenv package from your distro's package manager
    $ virtualenv2 venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
  Now that you are in a safe python2 sandbox you can proceed

* Install flask using pip
    
    ```
    $ pip install flask
    $ # It should fetch all the dependencies
    ```
    
* Checkout the issues and the **TODO** section in README.md to find something to
  work on

* Have something else in mind? Found a bug? Add an issue in the original repo
  before you start working

* When you are done writing code make sure to add a copyright line in the file
  you worked on. But first read LICENSE.txt and be sure you agree with those terms

* Test run your code

    ```
    $ python2 app.py
    $ # Go to 127.0.0.1:5000 in a browser
    ```
    
* Add a nice commit message and send in a pull request

* Get it merged, and voila, you sir, are a webedu ninja now :smile:
